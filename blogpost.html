<h6>I almost hated my whole day at school today ! You know when you get laughed at ? Well my day at school first started when we were doing this story about "My Worst Ouch Story" well I said about this moment when I got bit by a squirrel at Vicitora Park ,you may think this is funny but it isn't because if you think it is so funny then you are probably Paxton or one of his friends, they torcher me so much I hated them and wanted to cry everyday about them ,you would'nt want someone to tell mostly the entire class about ideas like my personal squrriel story ,right ? </h6>
