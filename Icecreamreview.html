    <h7> If you are looking for a great place to relax and get good vibes, I suggest to come down to this ice cream parlour! The service is fast and kind, the dishes are always as clean as they can possibly be and the food is luxurious for such a cheap price! Come down here and taste this great sensation!</h7>

   <b><H5> RATING - 4.5 OUT OF 5</H5></b>
    <h7> This place is pretty good compared to the last ice cream parlour I tasted which was "Thunder's  Ice Cream." It was disgusting and icky because everything was melted. Perhaps, it was because it was run by a little boy at a ice cream stand on a hot day. Anyways, everyone knows I am one of the most pickiest ice cream eaters in this town.  The best I could possibly give to a cheap and delicious ice cream parlour would be 4.5 because it could have been cleaner. I saw a bit of 'Sour Raspberry' ice cream in my 'Pearl White Mystery Vanilla' ice cream. Fix up the mess and make the ice cream cheaper, then I shall give you a 5.

    <h7> I always wanted to taste watermelon and sour apple ice cream! You can find this flavour nowhere else! The service was a bit slow (maybe because it was Valentine's Day and everyone wanted the 'Cherry with White Hearts' ice cream.) Although, they were kind and got us a free drink  of our choice because of the hassel. I recently visited a 'luxury' ice cream parlour and it was WAY  worse. I'd much rather 'Marina's Ice Cream Parlour' because it's more cheaper and more yummy!  </h7>
